# GW Detection of Supernova using Convolutional Neural Network

This project was worked with Dr. Javier Antelis, ITESM's proffesor, for the DELFIN program.

The project consist in a biclass classificator of GW embedded or noise using a Convolutional Neural Network (Tensorflow). The input is an image of one color and the output would be mentioned above. 

If you want more information about the code, how to use it, the data that was used for the project or any information related to the project feel free to send me an email gabrielgh@live.com.mx
